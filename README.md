# Reliability-Constrained-Structural-Design-Optimization-Using-BIM-Based-Tools
This project focuses on reliability-constrained structural design optimization by integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. It aims to achieve a safe, economical, and sustainable design while handling real-world uncertainties in material properties and loads.
